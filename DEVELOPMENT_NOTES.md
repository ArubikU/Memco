# MemCore Development Notes

## Week 1: Initial Architecture

Started with the core memory system design. Decided on a SQLite backend for simplicity and portability. Implemented basic CRUD operations for memory records. Spent a lot of time thinking about the schema design - wanted to make sure it would be flexible enough for future extensions while remaining performant.

Key decisions:
- Use JSON for storing tags and metadata (flexibility)
- Store embeddings as serialized arrays (performance)
- Add encryption support from day one (security)

Challenges:
- Balancing flexibility with performance
- Designing a schema that works well for both structured and vector queries
- Setting up a clean architecture that would work across languages

## Week 2: Vector Search Implementation

Implemented the vector search functionality. Started with a simple cosine similarity approach for the MVP. Researched more advanced techniques like HNSW and FAISS but decided to keep it simple for now and optimize later.

Spent time optimizing the vector search for small to medium datasets. The current implementation works well for up to ~100K memories, which should be sufficient for most users initially.

Key achievements:
- Basic vector search with cosine similarity
- Embedding provider interfaces for OpenAI and Cohere
- Batch embedding generation for efficiency

TODO: Investigate approximate nearest neighbor algorithms for scaling to millions of memories.

## Week 3: MemQL Query Language

Designed and implemented the MemQL query language. Wanted something SQL-like but specialized for memory operations. The parser and executor took longer than expected, but the result is quite flexible.

Key features:
- WHERE clause with comparison operators
- ORDER BY for sorting results
- LIMIT for pagination
- Special handling for tags and metadata fields

Challenges:
- Parsing nested conditions
- Translating MemQL to efficient SQL queries
- Handling special fields like tags and metadata

Ideas for improvement:
- Add JOIN support for combining memory sets
- Implement aggregation functions
- Add support for more complex filtering

## Week 4: CLI and Server Implementation

Built the CLI interface and REST API server. Focused on providing a native option for server environments. This was challenging but rewarding - it's much more performant for server workloads.

Key achievements:
- Comprehensive CLI with rich output
- FastAPI server with full API coverage
- Client libraries for Python

Challenges:
- Ensuring consistent behavior across implementations
- Handling concurrency safely
- Implementing the MemQL parser efficiently

## Current Focus

Working on advanced compression to reduce storage requirements. The current implementation stores full text and embeddings, which can get large quickly. Looking at different compression algorithms and techniques to reduce storage while maintaining query performance.

Also starting on the synchronization system to allow multi-device usage. This is challenging because of potential conflicts and the need for efficient delta updates.

## Performance Notes

Current benchmarks on my development machine (M1 MacBook Pro):
- Memory addition: ~1000 memories/second
- Basic MemQL queries: ~5000 memories/second
- Vector search (1000 memories): ~50ms
- Vector search (10000 memories): ~300ms
- Vector search (100000 memories): ~2.5s

Need to optimize vector search for larger datasets. Looking at implementing:
- Vector quantization
- Approximate nearest neighbor algorithms
- Indexing strategies for hybrid search

## Deployment Considerations

For production deployments, considering:
- Docker containers for easy deployment
- Kubernetes operators for distributed mode
- Backup and restore procedures
- Monitoring and alerting integration

## Personal Notes

I'm really excited about the potential applications of MemCore. The combination of structured queries and vector search opens up so many possibilities for knowledge management and AI augmentation.

The most challenging part so far has been balancing simplicity with power. I want MemCore to be easy to use for simple cases but flexible enough for complex applications.

Next big challenge: scaling to billions of memories while maintaining performance. This will require significant architectural changes, but I believe it's achievable with the right approach.
