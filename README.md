# MemCore

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-green.svg)

A complete memory management system with vector search capabilities, designed for efficient storage, retrieval, and handling of information.

## 🚀 Features

* **Full Memory System**: Complete CRUD operations for memory records
* **Vector Search**: Semantic similarity search using embeddings
* **MemQL**: A custom query language for structured memory retrieval
* **Secure Storage**: Built-in encryption for sensitive content
* **Versatile API**: Programmatic access via CLI and REST API
* **Client Libraries**: Easy integration with applications

## 📋 Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* Dependencies listed in `setup.py`

## 🔧 Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install memco
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arubiku/memco.git
cd memco
pip install -e .
```

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Basic Example

```python
from memco import MemCore, MemoryBuilder
from memco.embedding import get_embedding_provider

# Initialize the embedding provider
embedding_provider = get_embedding_provider()

# Create an instance of the memory system with vector search capabilities
mem_system = MemCore(
    root_path=".memfolder",
    encryption_key="my_secret_key",
    embedding_provider=embedding_provider
)

# Create a memory builder with the embedding provider
builder = MemoryBuilder(embedding_provider)

# Create a new memory record with auto-generated embeddings
memory = builder.set_content("This is a memory example with vector embedding") \
                .set_tags(["example", "vector", "embedding"]) \
                .set_importance(0.8) \
                .set_source("example.py") \
                .build()

# Add the memory to the system
memory_id = mem_system.add_memory(memory, encrypted=True)
print(f"Memory created with ID: {memory_id}")

# Retrieve the memory
retrieved = mem_system.get_memory(memory_id)
print(f"Content: {retrieved.content}")
```

### Using the Client

```python
from memco_client import MemCoreClient

# Initialize the client
client = MemCoreClient("http://localhost:8000")

# Add a memory
memory = client.add_memory(
    content="This is a test memory",
    tags=["test", "example"],
    importance=0.8,
    source="example.py"
)

# Search for similar memories
similar = client.vector_search("test memory")
print(f"Found {len(similar)} similar memories")

# Execute a MemQL query
results = client.memql_query("SELECT WHERE tags == \"test\" ORDER BY importance DESC")
print(f"The query returned {len(results)} memories")
```

## 📚 Architecture

MemCore is designed as a modular memory management system with the following key components:

1. **Core Memory System**: Manages memory records and provides CRUD operations
2. **Vector Search**: Enables semantic similarity search using embeddings
3. **MemQL**: Query language for structured memory retrieval
4. **Storage Layer**: Handles memory persistence and recovery
5. **API Layer**: Provides programmatic access via CLI and REST API
6. **Client Libraries**: Simplifies integration with applications

For more details, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🗺️ Roadmap

We're continuously improving MemCore. These are our goals for upcoming versions:

### v1.1.0 (June 2025)

* **Advanced Compression**
* **Synchronization System**
* **Performance Optimizations**

### v1.2.0 (July 2025)

* **Enhanced Security**
* **Advanced MemQL Features**
* **UI Components**

For more details, see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## 👥 Contributing
